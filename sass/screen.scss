/* Welcome to Compass.
 * In this file you should write your main styles. (or centralize your imports)
 * Import this file using the following HTML or equivalent:
 * <link href="/stylesheets/screen.css" media="screen, projection" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /> 
 * 
 * COMPASS MODULES (.sass/.scss files) ARE NOT STORED IN A REMOTE URL - AND NOT IN YOUR PROJECT FOLDER!
 * It's also important to note that when importing compass modules (.sass/.scss files), the actual physical file 
 * does not exist anywhere in your project folder. Instead, it's loaded from a remote URL which is predetermined by the
 * COMPASS app - so don't try to locate "compass/reset" in your project folder, because it doesn't live there to begin with.
