# Welcome to the 'sass-test' demo!

This is my first real attempt at creating a barebones SASS/Compass demo page while utilizing Git for version control and documentation.

<br />
**Here are the details of the project:**

* <p>Running Ruby on Windows 8.1 (installed using [RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org/))</p>
* <p>SASS/Compass installed through the command line using `$ gem install compass`. The compass installation includes SASS so this is all you need to get started.</p>
* <p>Structure of SASS files based on [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) principle.</p>
* <p>Organization of SASS code is directly borrowed from [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). I mean, if you're going to learn, you might as well learn from the people who built Bootstrap (and/or [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) for that matter).</p>
